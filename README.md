# pfSense Lab Project

This repository contains a pfSense-based virtual lab originally assigned by M. Bounama, my former networking instructor. I expanded the project with a complete virtual network setup and documentation.

## What's Included

- 🔐 pfSense firewall with WAN and dual LAN segments
- 🖥️ Vulnerable host (Metasploitable) for penetration testing
- 📄 Full project documentation on Notion *(request access)*
- 💾 Pre-installed lab environment on an SSD with a run script

## Access and Demo

To view the Notion documentation or see a live demonstration (running locally from my SSD), feel free to contact me.
