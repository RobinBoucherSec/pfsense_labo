# pfSense Lab Project

This repository contains a networking lab project originally assigned by M. Bounama, my former teacher. I expanded on the original instructions by developing a complete lab environment, documenting the process in Notion, and packaging everything on a bootable SSD with a run-script.

## What's Included

- 🔐 pfSense firewall with WAN and dual LAN segments
- 🖥️ Vulnerable host (Metasploitable) for penetration testing
- 📄 Full project documentation on Notion *(request access)*
- 💾 Pre-installed lab environment on an SSD with a run script

## What is covered

Network segmentation - DHCP configs - Access control - IDS/IPS - Network analysis - Security testing - Troubleshooting - and more

## Access and Demo

To view the Notion documentation or see a live demonstration (running locally from my SSD), feel free to contact me.
